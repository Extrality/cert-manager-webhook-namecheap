Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

The issuers have been created in the {{ .Release.Namespace }} namespace, and
will use {{ .Values.email }} as its email address -- if this is wrong, please run:

  $ helm upgrade --set email=yourname@example.com {{ .Release.Name  }} <chart directory>

They will require you to create a secret like this:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.secret }}
type: Opaque
stringData:
  apiKey: my_api_key_from_namecheap
  apiUser: my_username_from_namecheap

Remember that you'll need to whitelist your public IP from where this webhook
will come from to use this.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get all {{ .Release.Name }}
