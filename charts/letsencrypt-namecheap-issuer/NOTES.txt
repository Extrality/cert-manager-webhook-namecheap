Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

The issuers have been created in the {{ .Release.Namespace }} namespace, and
will use {{ .Values.email }} as its email address -- if this is wrong, please
run:

  $ helm upgrade --set email=yourname@example.com {{ .Release.Name  }} <chart directory>

They will require you to create a secret named `{{ .Values.secret }}` with the
keys `apiUser` and `apiKey` with your keys from Namecheap

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
